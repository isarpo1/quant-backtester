# quant-backtester
Backtesting and machine learning pipeline for systematic trading strategies. Includes data ingestion, feature engineering, strategy simulation, and performance visualization.
This project is a quantitative trading backtester and ML pipeline built in Python. It ingests free market data (via Yahoo Finance), generates trading signals (e.g., moving averages, momentum, ML-based predictions), and runs backtests to compare performance against a buy-and-hold benchmark. It also includes portfolio tracking, risk metrics, and visualizations.

The goal is to demonstrate how cloud-native software engineering + financial modeling can be combined to prototype systematic trading strategies, bridging the gap between research and production-ready quant systems.
